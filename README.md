# PinkThink
"PinkThink is an interest-oriented and peer-supported web and mobile platform that makes (S)cience, (T)echnology, (E)ngineering, and (M)ath education powerful, relevant, and engaging for girls. We specifically target girls age 8-14, when they are most at risk for losing interest in STEM. Driven to make coding and programming accessible and relevant to young girls, we have created Codeable Style (cStyle) Bracelets. The bracelet connects to a smart phone, tablet or computer via a USB cord and can be coded to light up in over 250 different colors, blink, fade, and change colors based on body and ambient temperature like a Mood Bracelet. PinkThink is partnering with Perspectives Charter Schools in Chicago to use cStyle as the basis for their new coding classes. We would like the Hackers to create the front end development of the cStyle platform. Parameters: In order to effectively engage girls the platform must incorporate PinkThink's product development model, called the PinkThink Approach: Peer-Supported: The platform must include some sort of mechanism that allows girls to share with each other. Gamified: Girls should be able to receive rewards, points or recognition for increasing their coding knowledge. Interest-Oriented: Girls need to be able to store and upload codes to the wearable so the platform must use Arduino on the back-end so it works with our hardware." - (https://empowherment.qualcomm.com/#projects-anchor)
